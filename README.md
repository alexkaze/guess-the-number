# Guess my number

- At the very beginning you are asked to input a numeric range in which you are going to guess the number.
- If you do not input anything the default range will be between 1 and 20.
- The score is the number of your attempts to guess the correct number.
- The highscore is a minimum attempts you needed to guess the correct number.
- Reset button refreshes random number to guess. It does not change the initial range.
- If you want to restart the whole game and define another numeric range you should just refresh the web page.
